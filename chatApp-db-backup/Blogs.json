    "fullDesc": "In this blog, we’re discussing in brief the impact of Coronovirus/Covid-19 outbreak on the travel & tourism industry in India, a topic that we can’t and must not ignore.\n\nI will be honest with you, I did find it difficult to keep my calm while researching this topic, since it directly affects me and the business I am part of. But, as a company, we felt the need to discuss this topic with you, for it’s better to have a known devil than an unknown angel.\n\nTravel & tourism industry in India has been a significant contributor to the country’s GDP. The sector even generates a large employment base. So when by mid-March, the popular tourist attractions in India started to close down, and the news on putting a halt on flying began to make rounds, we all started to predict the grim future of the travel industry in the country already. In fact the shutting down of the iconic Taj Mahal on March 17, 2020, which attracts millions of visitors every year, was a sign enough to assess the hard blow this pandemic was launching at us.\n\nIn this blog, we will try to understand the importance of the tourism sector in India’s economy; the present and future impacts of the pandemic; and the proposed measures and recovery plans.",

No matter how many pictures of the Taj Mahal we’ve all seen, there is nothing that prepares you for the actual beauty of the place. Glistening white in the morning sunshine, rising from the misty river banks behind.  Just like the Taj, first time India is an experience best enjoyed without expectations and pre-judgements.",

    "title": "DIABETES",
    "fullDesc": "WHAT IS DIABETES\n\nWhen we eat food, our body digests that food and converts it into GLUCOSE. Glucose provides our cells with energy needed to function. Everything that we do like breathing, moving around requires energy. And this energy is provided to us by Glucose.\n\nGlucose is made from the food that we eat. If we eat carbohydrates, the body is able to make glucose very fast and easily. Our blood then carries the glucose to each cell in the body. The cells then converts the glucose into energy.\n\nBut how is this done? \n\nOur Pancreas produce a hormone called INSULIN. Once the glucose in the blood reaches a cell, say in the heart, it cannot just get absorbed by the cell. First the pancreas will see that the level of glucose or SUGAR in the blood is high, because you just had a big lunch. So it will release Insulin into the blood. Insulin is like a key for the sugar to enter the cell. It tells the cell to let the sugar in. Only then does your cell absorb the glucose, and you get energy from your food. \n\nWhat happens if there is no insulin?\n\nThe sugar in the blood cannot enter the cell without insulin. So it just stays in the blood. It has nowhere else to go. So it just keeps traveling to all parts of your body along with the blood. \n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nWithout insulin, the sugar in your blood just keeps waiting to enter your cell.. And your cell is also waiting for the insulin to open the lock and let the sugar in. So your cells have no energy to function even though you are eating well. \n\nThe result?\n\nYou feel tired. You feel restless. Your body wants to get rid of the sugar in the blood. So it makes you feel thirsty so that you drink more water. You drink more water so you pee more. Your body can’t get energy so it starts breaking down the muscle and fat so that you have some energy. You start losing weight. You start looking thinner, you get dark circles, your hair starts to fall out. Your lips and skin go dry. You can’t do any work for a long time, you get tired doing simple tasks.\n\n\n",

She was always sick, until one day, suddenly, she changed.\n\nThe situation was the same, but she was different.\n \nOne day my dad said to her:\n\n- I've been looking for a job for three months and I haven't found anything, I'm going to have a few beers with friends.\n \nMy mom replied:\n- It's okay.\n \nMy brother said to her:\n- Mom, I'm doing poorly in all subjects at the University ...\n \nMy mom replied:\n- Okay, you will recover, and if you don't, well, you repeat the semester, but you pay the tuition.\n \nMy sister said to her:\n- Mom, I hit the car.\n \nMy mom replied:\n- Okay daughter, take it to the workshop, find how to pay and while they fix it, get around by bus or subway.\n \nHer daughter-in-law said to her:\n- Mother-in-law, I come to spend a few months with you.\n \nMy mom replied:\n- Okay, settle in the living room couch and look for some blankets in the closet.\n \nAll of us at my mom's house gathered worried to see these reactions.\n\nWe suspected that she had gone to the doctor and that she was prescribe some pills of \"I don't give a damn about 1000 mg.\"\n\nShe would probably also be ingesting an overdose.\n\nWe then proposed to do an \"intervention\" to my mother to remove her from any possible addiction she had towards some anti-tantrum medication.\n \nBut what was not the surprise, when we all gathered around her and my mom explained:\n \n\"It took me a long time to realize that each person is responsible for their life, it took me years to discover that my anguish, my mortification, my depression, my courage, my insomnia and my stress, did not solve their problems but aggravated mine.\n\nI am not responsible for the actions of others, but I am responsible for the reactions I express to that.\n\nTherefore, I came to the conclusion that my duty to myself is to remain calm and let each one solve what corresponds to them.\n \nI have taken courses in yoga, meditation, miracles, human development, mental hygiene, vibration and neurolinguistic programming, and in all of them, I found a common denominator: finally they all lead to the same point.\n\nAnd, it is that I can only interfere with myself, you have all the necessary resources to solve your own lives.\n\nI can only give you my advice if you ask me and it depends on you to follow it or not.\n \nSo, from now on, I cease to be: the receptacle of your responsibilities, the sack of your guilt, the laundress of your remorse, the advocate of your faults, the wall of your lamentations, the depositary of your duties, who should solve your problems or spare a tire every time to fulfill your responsibilities.\nFrom now on, I declare all independent and self-sufficient adults.\n \nEveryone at my mom's house was speechless.\n\nFrom that day on, the family began to function better, because everyone in the house knows exactly what it is that they need to do.  \n\nAuthor:\nA HAPPY WOMAN!!\n\nPhoto credits: <span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@benignohoyuela?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Benigno Hoyuela</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/t/health?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span>",
